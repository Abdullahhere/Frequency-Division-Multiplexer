# Frequency-Division-Multiplexer
Frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) is a multiplexing technique that combines many signals into a single signal at the sender’s end. It then passes on to receiver’s end where it is de-multiplexed. In FDM, the bandwidth of a link is greater than the combined bandwidths of the signals to be transmitted, and the available transmission channel bandwidth is thus divided into a number of non-overlapping frequency bands. Signals from all sources are transmitted simultaneously, but each one occupying a different frequency band. It has vast applications including television networks, FM and AM broadcasting and cellular phones. Overall this project was a great experience for us and it helped us learn a lot. We used different tools, techniques and concepts of our course in this project.
